<section><h1>Your Ideas ➡ Tech</h1><h2 class="author">Rich Daley</h2><img class="logo" src="img/logo.png"></section><section><section><h2>What I do</h2><img class="featured" src="img/tech.svg"><aside class="notes"><p>Full-stack software developer - building bits of the internet.</p><p>"Helping startups get started" - you have the idea, the money and the expertise, I'll bring the tech.</p><p>What I build are apps - strictly speaking - and not websites.</p></aside></section><section><h2>USDL technologists</h2><img class="featured" src="img/technologists.svg"><aside class="notes"><p>Loose network of technical professionals.</p><p>Brought in halfway through the process, when the problem has been distilled down to a single question.</p><p>From my perspective, our job is to help find a simple technological solution to that single question, which can be implemented in 2 weeks or less.</p><p>Innovation doesn't happen with just a technologist - domain expertise is essential. Domestic violence story.</p><p>This is like a micro version of the way I innovate with all my clients.</p></aside></section></section><section><section><h2>The idea</h2><img class="featured" src="img/idea.png"><aside class="notes"><p>Typically when someone comes to me, they have a pretty good idea what it is they want.</p><p>Some software developers just take these ideas and run with them - producing exactly what's in the client's head.</p><p>I prefer to innovate together with the client, finding the best union of the client's domain expertise and my understanding of the technology.</p><p>A good example is mobile apps - is that really what you need? Or is it an unnecessary expense, when solutions like PWA exist?</p></aside></section><section><h2>The right questions</h2><img class="featured" src="img/detective.svg"><aside class="notes"><p>The most important part of innovation is asking the right questions.</p><p>Questions to help understanding the domain better and respecting the client's knowledge</p><p>Questioning whether something is technologically possible</p><p>Questioning the approach. Is it financially feasible - is there a simpler solution that can provide the same results?</p><p>Taking into account trends or changes in the industry - things I have to keep on top of but the client might not know. For example, PWA, SPA, changes in autoplay functionality, etc.</p><p>Careview example: does it really need to be a mobile app, with all the bureaucracy/complication? Or is PWA the solution? iOS 11.3</p></aside></section><section><h2>Thinking like a machine</h2><img class="featured" src="img/brain.svg"><aside class="notes"><p>So much of software engineering is breaking free of human thought and thinking like a computer.</p><p>Examples:</p><ul><li>Relational data / REST - breaking your world up into resources and verbs.</li><li>Security - how do computers develop trust?</li><li>Separation of concerns - content, presentation and user interaction are. different things.</li><li>Testing &amp; regression - machines behaving like people. What people? Design for the most unusual cases.</li></ul><p>Careview example: how to secure the data so it can't be used to target vulnerable people. Encryption in transit vs at rest.</p></aside></section><section><h2>Iterative development</h2><img class="featured" src="img/iterative.svg"><aside class="notes"><p>Innovation is an ongoing process.</p><p>The trick is to find the smallest step possible and get that in front of users as quickly as possible, get feedback, and let that inform the next direction.</p><p>You can do this over and over forever - sometimes what you have made after a few is nowhere near what you thought you were going to make, but it's miles better for it.</p><p>Regression testing stops later iterations becoming a nightmare to maintain.</p><p>Careview example: prototype developed swiftly without tests. Discarded. New one GPS-only at first. Usability workshop. V2.</p></aside></section></section><section><h2>Why local micro-business?</h2><img class="featured borderless" src="img/leeds.svg"><aside class="notes"><ul><li>We care about the city.</li><li>We are engaged and responsive.</li><li>We have communities, like Duke Studios.</li></ul></aside></section><section><img class="logo" src="img/logo.png"><p>https://www.fishpercolator.co.uk/</p><p>@fishpercolator</p></section>
